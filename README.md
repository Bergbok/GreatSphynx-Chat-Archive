On May 19, 2025 Twitch will implement a 100-hour storage limit for [highlights](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand#highlights) and [uploads](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand#uploads). Channels still over the limit by the deadline will have their content deleted until they have been brought under the 100-hour limit, along with their chat replays.

This repository aims to preserve [the greatest IRC channel on the internet](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/greatsphynx/chat).

Uses [TwitchDownloader](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader)'s [CLI](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/blob/master/TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md) for downloading chat data as JSON and converting it to HTML. 

The downloaded JSON can be used to [render the chat as a video](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/blob/master/TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md#arguments-for-mode-chatrender) and is available on archive.org here:
